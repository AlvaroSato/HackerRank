# HackerRank

Hi there 👋, In this repository I will have all my codes for solving HackerRank problems. As my main language is currently Python, I will be solving problems first in this language, but in the future I intend to solve problems in other languages, so I will be structuring the folders as follows:

📁 Repository  
&nbsp;└ 📁 Difficult / Preparation Kit  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └ 📁 Language  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└ 📖 Code
